        An Intro to TBT
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
        This is a Turn Based Tactics Mech Game. I've not gotten around to naming it yet. So I've just been rolling with TBT as a runnings name. 
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Starting as an initial "keep my skills sharp while moving into doing more admin style things for my day job" toy project there is currently a variety of diffrent concepts and ideals all slammed together. There will eventually be a trimming and pruning that will make it make sense again. 
        The inception of the concept was "What if I had trading cards that I could just drag into a project and have a character spawn for that card". The "Cards" being a bit of stego on a PNG with a SQLite db stuck in there. 
        This has inevitably progress to a "export my design to a mate" as well as dreams of roguelike designs. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The mechanics might be in flux and constantly shifting between concepts, but something that has stayed consistent is the concept of "mod as a trading card" which has always had particular appeal to me personally.
        The visual style has experienced simular flux, initially starting as a PSX concept it's moved a little deeped into fidility.  
        The style is inspired by a dear friend of mine's love for the psudo relgious mech lore themes. 
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        There is also some ideas around "If I'm shipping a mech in a card, probably need to explain a mech in the card as well"

        After the initial bit of fun dealing with Models, Mechs, UI code, POC implementation of dragging cards into the Unity and a very humorous version of the exported cards.

      <p>
          After collecting all the bits and pieces together in some sort of shape and form it was time to start getting into the data of it all. 
          As usual my initial SQL database layouts missed some things which was only noticed during actually using the data. 
          The main thing I noticed was loading a blob object on each row was a terrible idea. So I moved all the models and textures in their own table. 
          The rest of the tables just point at those tables which allow me loading in all kinds of details of mechs and pilots etc. followed by loading the models as needed was much kinder to memory.

      <p>
        The choice of treating all the loading logic etc as a managed DLL was made pretty early on, which I've been enjoying alot, along with sweet nothing lies such as "then I can just use the same card logic in another game by dragging on one DLL".
        Which is clearly a soothing lie I tell myself. 
        Turned out to be very convenient. 
        The initial process of "close and reopen unity" after each rebuild to be able to test if my code workd was rather annoying but after some poking and scratching around in the back of my head I remembered this is why Unit Tests exists.
        After some customization and some basic Unit tests for the newer section of my managed plugin, I am having a lovely time working on this plugin now.

        I also realised I can get git style versioning from <a href="https://dbhub.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">dbhub.io</a> which has been profoundly useful to me during this process.
